			MACE


MACE is a Mathematical program for Algorithms, Calculations and Equations
in Number Theory, Algebra and Linear Algebra. It is designed to be as easy to
run as a hand-held calculatur.

MACE is free software and may be freely copied on the terms contained in the
files COPYING.LESSER and COPYING.


                       Compile

MACE is written in QT 4.7.4. For compiling MACE on your computer you should have QT 4.7.4 or a higher version.

Create a new directory "~/MACE" and put the header files, cpp files and the ui file in this directory. Then

      cd ~/MACE
      qmake -project
      qmake
      make/nmake/gmake (depending on your OS)


			Hints

Data types: MACE computes with double, (double, double) complex numbers and rest
classes in ZZ/(n). For several functions MACE calculates with arbitrary precision
integers, rational numbers and elements of QQ(i), if arbitrary precision is
needed. Moreover polynomials and matrices over ZZ/(n), (double, double) complex
numbers and arbitrary precision QQ(i) are implemented.

Arithmetic Operations: By using brackets, it is possible to compose several
arithmetic operations.

Powers: For two real numbers a and b one can compute the power a^b by entering it.
For all other types of data only the power by a positive integer is implemented.

Matrices and Linear Equations: First choose the number of columns and lines and then
press the "write matrix" button or the button of another function for matrices of
your choice. For the addition, subtraction and multiplication of matrices you find
seperate buttons in the "Linear Algebra" section. If you like to solve a system of
linear equations given by Ax = b for a matrix A and a vector b, first choose the
lines and columns for A and press the "linear equations" button then.

Polynomials: Polynomials can be entered in the form "a_nx^n+...+a_1x+a_0". In
characteristic n>0 the polynomials are defined over ZZ/(n) and in characteristic 0
polynomials can have complex coefficients.
